            My experience of traveling at Cox's Bazar for the first time was so amazing an refreshing. Cox,s bazar is the worlds largest sea beach. Me and my friends were very exited to give a try on parasailing. It was a very thrilling ride and such an amazing experience. We eat seafood, drink coconut water etc. I made a list of food that we eat and some groceries I bought at Cox's Bazar.
